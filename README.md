# Introduction to R and RStudio

This repo contains the materials for a 2-hour introductory RStudio workshop. 
I wrote this workshop for the Maths Skills Centre at the University of York.

The workshop teaches learners the basics of RStudio and the tidyverse. 
Specifically, the following topics are covered:
* An overview of RStudio;
* Writing code in a script;
* Importing and viewing data;
* Writing code in a script;
* Plotting data with ggplot2. 

The workshop was designed to be taught in Carpentries-style live coding.
